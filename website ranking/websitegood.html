            <p>I was a big fan of the Apple website because their designs really perfected what they were trying to portray. Their website is sleek and professional, but also has vibrant colors and vivid images that show the kind of professional yet fun company that Apple tries to convey. This website is actually one of the best designed pages I have seen and has options that many other websites simply cannot compete with. Like anticipated, their HTML sheet is very organized and contains many smaller div tags to add flare and uniqueness to each portion of their page. The layout of this webpage is top notch. When first opening to their home page, viewers are presented with a professional and business-like appearance, but the scroll effect on this site is unreal. Not only are there various chunks of scroll-down options, but there are also smaller elements inside each of the sections that show things moving and animation occurring, which is extremely entertaining and unique to viewers. Navigation is an easy task on this webpage. Without a section of a header up-top, the navigation bar continues to remain on the top of the webpage even as viewers continue to scroll down. This navigation bar is easy to understand because the font and colors are simple. The colors on the Apple webpage are, yet again, perfect for the companies image. They are set to a primarily black background causing each of the colors to really POP and be even more vibrant than against a white background. The largest aspect of the Apple webpage that makes it so much better than the others in the scroll method. Even on every link you click on, Apple continues to impress with elaborate and beautifully created sections throughout a page that mesh and project the company's image perfectly. </p>
