            <p>The LuluLemon website is very simple and classic. Their simplicity is seen with their pick of only a few unique colors: red, white, and black. This color scheme is shown in all aspects of their website which leads viewers to a relaxed and easy to access web page. The code on this website is also simple and modern. The creator of the website uses multiple div tags that are all located at the top of the HTML sheet. The layout of this website is also simple and makes sense to viewers. The homepage has multiple sections in the format which creates a long scroll down effect that shows multiple types of clothing and sale offerings the further the viewer scrolls. The website is very easy to navigate through because of the pure simplicity of the website. The navigation bars opens up when clicked on to multiple other navigation options that would appear under the chosen category. Like I said previously, the colors of this website are very crucial in their design. The red, white, and black colors create a sleek and professional feel, while also keeping the focus of their webpage strictly on the images of models and clothing. The little things that set this website include white space, strategic placement of font (not just in classic locations, but actually integrated into the images), and their navigation bars. The most significant "little thing" that I enjoyed about this website was how a red line scrolls through as I move my cursor between options. This option creates an aesthetically pleasing view for users, but also allows for viewers to have a brief look at what they viewed last.</p>
