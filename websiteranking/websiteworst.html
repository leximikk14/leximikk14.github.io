            <p>Ling's Car Sales website is horrible. The entire page is cluttered and crazy and gives off the persona that this website is absolutely NOT trustworthy. The page is set up in a very unorganized manner and is hard to understand overall. Everything from the background to the navigation is hard to read and understand. Ling’s website code is actually hilarious. It is messy and does it not make sense, but along with that, contains a picture of him written in HTML code and the saying "Mess with my website and you are DEAD.". The layout of the website also does not make sense. The navigation bar is located on a side set up and is clustered and almost lost in the mix, while the scroll down option gives off the sense that this page, in fact, is the only option to view his products. The colors are crazy and have no specific sense of theme or organization. The background of this webpage is purple with paisley, while the rest of the webpage is actually crazy and has images on Ling riding a motorcycle or doing other crazy things. Little things in Ling's webpage add up to many GIF’s that are confusing and overwhelming for viewers. Overall, if this website is an actual car leasing company, I would be very surprised if anyone used their products. </p>
