            <h1>History of the Holiday</h1>
            <p><img src="loveisallyouneed.jpg" class="bgpic">The holiday has origins in the Roman festival of Lupercalia, held in mid-February. ... At the end of the 5th century, Pope Gelasius I replaced Lupercalia with St. Valentine's Day. It came to be celebrated as a day of romance from about the 14th century. Formal messages, or valentines, appeared in the 1500s, and by the late 1700s commercially printed cards were being used. The first commercial valentines in the United States were printed in the mid-1800s. Valentines commonly depict Cupid, the Roman god of love, along with hearts, traditionally the seat of emotion. </p>
