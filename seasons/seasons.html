            <p>The seasons of the year include spring, summer, winter, and autumn. As time goes on and these seasons pass by, the weather changes, the temperature changes, and the look of outside world changes dramatically.</p>
                <h2>Spring</h2>
                <p1>Spring and "springtime" refer to the season, and also to ideas of rebirth, rejuvenation, renewal, resurrection and regrowth.</p1>
                <h3>Summer</h3>
                <p1>Summer is the hottest of the four temperate seasons, falling after spring and before autumn. At the summer solstice, the days are longest and the nights are shortest, with day-length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice.</p1>
                <h4>Autumn</h4>
                <p1>Autumn is the season between summer and winter, ushering in colder temperatures. One of its main features is the shedding of leaves from deciduous trees.</p1>
                <h5>Winter</h5>
                <p1>Winter is the coldest season of the year in polar and temperate zones (winter does not occur in most of the tropical zone). It occurs after autumn and before spring in each year.</p1>
